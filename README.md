# Predicting-Loan-Default-Rates-for-Improved-Credit-Risk-Management
The goal is to predict whether a person will default on a credit application or not, based on various features such as the duration of the credit, the amount of the credit, the person's age, employment status, etc.
The Python script is trying to build and evaluate two different machine learning models for the German Credit dataset: Logistic Regression and Random Forest. The goal is to predict whether a person will default on a credit application or not, based on various features such as the duration of the credit, the amount of the credit, the person's age, employment status, etc.
The script first loads the dataset and performs some data cleaning and exploration, such as replacing some values and one-hot encoding the categorical variables. Then, the dataset is split into training and testing sets, and feature scaling is applied using StandardScaler. The Logistic Regression model is then fit on the training data and evaluated on the testing data using various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report, ROC curve and AUC score.
Next, the Random Forest model is fit and evaluated using the same evaluation metrics. The aim is to compare the performance of these two models and choose the one that performs better on this specific task.
